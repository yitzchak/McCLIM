;;; INCREMENTAL-REDISPLAY takes as input the difference set computed by
;;; COMPUTE-DIFFERENCE-SET and updates the screen. The 5 kinds of updates are
;;; not very well defined in the spec. I understand their semantics thus:
;;;
;;; ERASES, MOVES, and DRAWS refer to records that don't overlap *with other
;;; records that survive in the current rendering*. In other words, they don't
;;; overlap with records that were not considered by COMPUTE-DIFFRENCE-SET,
;;; either because they are children of a clean updating output node or they
;;; are in another part of the output history that is not being redisplayed.
;;;
;;; Another way to think about erases, moves and draws is in terms of a
;;; possible implementation:
;;;
;;; - ERASES regions would be erased
;;; - MOVES regions would be blitted
;;; - DRAWS records would be replayed
;;;
;;; Records in ERASE-OVERLAPPING and MOVE-OVERLAPPING might overlap with any
;;; other record. They need to be implemented by erasing their region on the
;;; screen and then replaying the output history for that region. Thus, any
;;; ordering issues implied by overlapping records is handled correctly. Note
;;; that DRAWS records may be drawn without concern for the history because
;;; they additive. -- jd 2021-12-01
